            <p id= "siteDescribe">Q-Bism is a site where you can learn about the history, art, and legacy of the cubist movement, one of the most important art movements of the early 20th century. Heavily tied to reactions to war and a desire to depict the world objectively and yet in new and innovative ways, Cubism is one of the most well known art movements in modern history, and an integral force that helped shape modern art, abstract and otherwise.</p> <!--literally just regular text-->

                <h2 class="sectionTitle" id="#story">The History of Cubism</h2>
                <p>The origins of Cubism can be traced back to the early 20th century, in France. While being supported by an art dealer known as Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and other artists would experiment in their art by depicting their subjects as naught but a collection of geometric shapes. One piece that would influence (but not create) the movement was Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. This piece is considered Proto-Cubist, as it shares many similarities to full Cubist art, but does not go all the way in portraying the subject purely using geometric shapes. The movement would become truly recognized by the year 1911.</p>

                <li>The most notable player in the origin of the Cubist movement is most definitely Pablo Picasso. He experimented with many styles over the course of his life, but he played a large role in the creation of the cubist movement, and his work with it and in creating it has left a large impact on art, both abstract and not.</li>
                <li>Another major player in the history and origins of the Cubist movement is Georges Braque. Braque worked closely with Picasso, and while they worked solo, they both created art for the same patron who would influence the creation of the Cubist style.</li>

            <h2 class="sectionTitle" id="legacy">Its Legacy</h2>
            <article>The legacy of Cubism is very plain to see. Originally, it started in a sense similar to Impressionism, where the truth of the subject would be revealed by illustrating and painting it, not in a way that is photorealistic, but that strikes at the core truth. Impressionism attempted to replicate this truth by replicating the light of the subject, while Cubism broke it down to its base elements of geometric shapes. This would give way to the idea of putting emotions down on the canvas by way of splattering paint, and using even more abstract approaches to illustrating a subject to get across ideas. While not the first style of abstract art, Cubism can definitely be considered one of the first modern examples.</article>
